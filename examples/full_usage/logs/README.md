# Full Usage Example Logs Directory
This directory is where the example should create a file `latest.log`.

**DO NOT** remove  this readme from git. Having a file in this directory assures that
this directory always exists with the example. If the directory doesn't exist when the
example is run, then no file logging will happen.
